          So you're reading to sell and you've got a number in mind. But what if
          you could get more? There's a good chance you can - especially if your
          home is at least 10 years old (or hasn't been updated in that long). A
          relatively small investment up front can add tens of thousands of
          dollars to your original asking price. Here are just a few things you
          should consider.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic landscaping</h2>
        <p>
          Good landscaping can add anywhere from 7-15% to your home's total
          value. So it's worth it to spend some time (or hire someone to) do a
          bit of basic landscaping. You don't have to rip everything up.
          Consider planting a few small shrubs, clean up your lawn's edges, add
          a hanging plant here and there, and make sure your property is clear
          of any debris.

          <h2>Paint</h2>
          <p>
            If there's only one thing you do to update your home, it should be
            painting it. A fresh coat on your front door adds to your curb
            appeal. Repainting your kitchen cabinets is much less expensive than
            replacing them, and makes them look brand new. And of course,
            updating your walls to a neutral color adds an air of newness to any
            home.

        <h2>Update Fixtures</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few things that do as much to update the look of your home
          as new fixtures. Installing modern light fixtures in shared areas can
          (literally and figuratively) brighten a room. A new faucet can
          rejuvenate your whole kitchen. And new handles can make decades-old
          cabinets look brand new. It's as close to a complete renovation as you
          can get without spending thousands of dollars.

        <h2>Pressure Wash</h2>
        <p>
          There could be years'—if not decades'— worth of grime all over your
          property. It's not something you can just hose off. But, you can
          powerwash it off. In a single afternoon you'll take years of weather
          wear off your fence, driveway, garage door, and most other surfaces,
          adding a fresh look to your home. Pressure washers can be rented by
          the data from many home improvement retailers. Note: avoid pressure
          washing vinyl siding; water can get between the siding and the vapor
          barrier.

            <h2>Hire an Inspector</h2>
            <p>
              No one likes surprises. So while serious buyers will likely hire
              an inspector to ensure everything is as it should be, you should
              do the same—before you even list it. You'll identify any issues
              that could be deal breakers and lower the value of your home.
              Addressing them upfront will help you avoid the disappointment of
              fielding lower offers of having offers revoked altogether.
